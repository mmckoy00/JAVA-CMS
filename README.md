Java-CMS is a Swing-based Java application for capturing student complaints, allowing a student service supervisor to view new complaints and assign them to a student service advisor.

## Getting Started

To use the application, you will need to clone the repository and start the server located in the `JAVA-CMS/ServerApp/src/server` directory. Then, open the `JAVA-CMS/ClientApp/src/frames/MainFrame.java` file to launch the application.

## Usage

Once you have launched the application, you can use it to capture student complaints by filling out the necessary fields and submitting the complaint. The student service supervisor can then view new complaints and assign them to a student service advisor. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.
